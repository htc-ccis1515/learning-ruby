Put your name, course number and day/time here.


## Summary
This is a series of programming assignments for introductory programming with Ruby.

__In-class__ assignments are hands on practice that are done as part of the reading and/or lecture for the week. These assignments tend to focus on single skills and have most or all of the code provided. They are intended to reinforce the reading and/or lecture for the week.

__Labs__ are assignments that add onto and develop the basic skills from reading and/or lectures. They require you to use what you have learned in different ways and combine separate concepts into a single solution. No solutions are available for the labs, but staff will help you *think through and solve* these problems if you need help and ask.

__Projects__ are larger assignments that you are expected to solve independently. While staff may help you *think through* tough spots if you get stuck, they should not help you write the code for the project assignments.
